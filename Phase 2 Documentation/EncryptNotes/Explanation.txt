This document is meant as a guide and a way to know or see how we saw it. Basically making it easy for others after us to know what's what and what things mean. So, these are old html files that I was thinking that we could use, but soon learned was incorrect of me to think. So, all I should say is that these are certainly usable, yet there not great or even good. Since they are not as nearly good as our future and complete project. So, only use as a guide not as an example. If your going to use something use python, MySQL, and HTML with Django or if not something else. Since Django was what we used for our project or other things since it would work better than this.
