Phase 4
- Finish Change Log and Lessons Learned Documents

- Finish AI note organization, currently working on this (Jacob)
- Align text with note lines on front end (KJ) 
- Bug test once AI note organization is finished, squash any bugs (everyone)
Last phase

 -- What do we want to show in it?  Will each member narrate a slide or two, then I can put it all together in a video with powerpoint slides?
