//Same as Phase 2//

This document is meant as a guide and a way to know or see how we saw it. Basically making it easy for others after us to know what's what and what things mean. So, this contains all of the documents that we created for this phase. While some are quite good and can certainly be used as a guide, others are not as great. So use with caution, if you are.
