# Information about the Explanation Documents
Those are in each Phase, in each separate folder (Documents, Diagrams and Such) so that whenever some is look at this repository. They can know what this or that is. Most state the same stuff but they are there to say this folder is for this and this folder's for that. I wanted to make as easy to navigate as possible. So, to those who read this I wish you luck and hope this can be of some use to you.   -Duncan, Team Manager

Best of Luck
