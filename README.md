# EncryptNotes
Short Project Description*:
EncryptNotes is a secure and user-friendly note-taking application that 
prioritizes privacy through end-to-end encryption. Users can store personal 
notes, reminders, and sensitive information with peace of mind, knowing that
only they can access their data. The application will feature an intuitive 
interface, support for text formatting, categorization of notes, and the 
ability to sync across multiple devices. Encryption ensures that notes are 
securely stored and decrypted only by the user, making this app ideal for 
individuals looking for a secure, private, and seamless note-taking experience.
